# BATCHA!

BATCHA! is a Layer-2 solution to reduce fees, prevent MEV, and strengthen privacy on Layer-1 blockchain. Such as Ethereum, BSC, even Polygon can be upgraded their dApp systems through BATCHA.

More precisely, it's a hybrid solution of Layer-2 and its own Layer-1. Therefore, BATCHA has a native token named "BATCH" to make consensus on `batchers`.

## Pain points of dApp users

### 1. Expensive Gas Fee

Massive pressures of fee make dApp users leave Ethereum. They use the alternate blockchain like BSC, Solana, Ava, Algorand or Layer-2 solution like Polygon instead of Ethereum.

* Because the atomic transaction via multiple blockchains is not possible, many users undergo discomforts to use and weave dApps.

* The best is that everyone use one Layer-1, Ethereum maybe, but this is impractical due to huge gas fees.

* How about everyone using the alternate chains such as BSC or Klaytn? Well, the gas (fee) problem can be relieved, but those centralized blockchains' users are suffering from MEV.

And, people really long for a way to cut fees.

* The active (lively) use of FlashBot and aggregators represents it.

### 2. Miner Extractable Value

MEV is an unfair advantage that a miner who creates a block obtains by manipulating the order of transactions or inserting new transactions before and after the transaction.

* `The dark forest` said that it is actually happening in many blockchains such as Ethereum.

* There are suspicions that MEV is more frequently occurring in centralized blockchains like BSC, Klaytn, et al.

* In (D)PoS chains such as Polygon, there is a problem that miners can seize more values through MEV and monopolize it through more staking. Like `Stake bleeding attack`.

### 3. Privacy

Behaviors in popular dApps can be tracked, such as massive moves in Swap. Eww.

## Can BATCHA! solve these problems?

Yep. Say it.
